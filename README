this is a simple quick'n'dirty chart generator for erlang systems. The erlang side consists of a little process that takes statistics every soandso many milliseconds, and writes them to a file in JSON format using mochijson2.

The perl side uses JSON (pure perl) or JSON::XS (C backend, much faster) to parse the json, and Chart::Strip to output nice-looking charts in png or jpg format.

SETUP:

THE ERLANG PART:
just let your supervisor start the statistics process like you would start any other process (i.e. using statistics:start_link()).
mochijson2.erl needs to be compiled and in your codepath.

THE PERL PART:
first install the following prerequisites:
- JSON
- Chart::Strip

you can do so using cpan or cpanp (I prefer cpanp):

$ cpan
CPAN Terminal> install JSON
... lots of output ... 
All OK.
CPAN Terminal> install Chart::Strip
... lots of output ...
All OK.

To verify wether a perl library was successfully installed you can use the following command:
perl -MLibraryname -e 'print "All OK!\n"'
so for example:
perl -MJSON -e 'print "All OK!\n"'

CONFIGURING THE PERL PART
if you look at the top of generate.pl you'll see the following:
my $STATFILE = "../erlang/stats.jsn";
my $OUTPUT_DIR = ".";
my $FORMAT = "png";

$STATFILE is the json file to be parsed.
$OUTPUT_DIR is the directory where the generated images are to be saved.
$FORMAT can be either png or jpg.
